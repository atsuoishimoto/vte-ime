Description: Terminal emulator widget for GTK+ 2.0 - runtime files
 The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then
 uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control
 sequence or just random data. The sample program "interpret" illustrates
 more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.

Description: Terminal emulator widget for GTK+ 2.0 - minimal runtime
 This is a udeb, or a microdeb, for the debian-installer.
 .
 The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then
 uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control
 sequence or just random data. The sample program "interpret" illustrates
 more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.

 This package contains the minimal runtime library needed by the Debian
 installer.
