Description: Terminal emulator widget for GTK+ 2.0 - runtime files
 The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then
 uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control
 sequence or just random data. The sample program "interpret" illustrates
 more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.
